Digital Signature Requirements

    Driver and Dispatch Signatures:
        Captured digitally on a touchscreen using HTML5 Canvas or a similar tool.
        Required for document handling and release verification.

    Security Considerations:
        Digital signatures stored securely in the database.
        Only authorized personnel (dispatch and security officers) can access signatures.
