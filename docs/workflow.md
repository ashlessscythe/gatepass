Gatepass Workflow

    Guard at Truck Gate:
        Enters driver and truck details upon arrival.
        Generates a Gatepass, assigns it to the driver, and sends it to dispatch.

    Dispatch Verification:
        Compares gatepass information against Bill of Lading (BOL) paperwork, trailer number, and driver name.
        Checks the truck into the yard management system and stamps the gatepass to verify check-in.

    Live Load Pickup:
        For live loads, dispatch assigns a pickup door on the gatepass and hands it back to the driver.

    Warehouse Document Handling:
        Warehouse sends necessary documents to dispatch.
        The driver signs, receives a seal if applicable, and dispatch records the seal number.

    Release and Exit:
        Dispatch completes the release section if thereâ€™s a change in the truck information.
        The guard seals the truck and verifies the trailer number, stamp, and other exit requirements.
