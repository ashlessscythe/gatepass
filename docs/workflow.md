Electronic Gatepass Workflow

    Guard at Truck Gate:
        Enter Details: The guard inputs driver and truck details into the electronic system upon arrival.
        Generate Form Number: The system generates a unique form number for each entry, which is printed on a ticket or slip and given to the driver.
        Driver Proceeds to Dispatch: The driver carries the form number to the dispatch office to retrieve their information.

    Dispatch Verification:
        Retrieve Driver Information: The driver presents the form number to dispatch, who uses it to pull up the driver’s information in the system.
        Verification: Dispatch verifies the driver’s details against the Bill of Lading (BOL), trailer number, and driver name to confirm accuracy.
        Check-In: Dispatch checks the truck into the yard management system, completing the electronic entry for the driver.
        Electronic Signature on SigPad: Dispatch may request the driver’s electronic signature on a signature pad to confirm information and completion of check-in.

    Live Load Pickup (if applicable):
        Assign Pickup Door: For live loads, dispatch assigns a pickup door within the system. The driver can be notified verbally or visually (such as a monitor) by dispatch.
        Driver Confirmation: The driver confirms the pickup assignment and proceeds to the assigned door.

    Warehouse Document Handling:
        Document Transfer to Dispatch: The warehouse prepares shipping documents that are physically handed to dispatch for further processing.
        Driver’s Physical Signature: The driver signs the physical shipping documents as required by warehouse procedures.
        Seal Assignment (if applicable): Dispatch records the seal number in the system and provides it to the driver if a seal is required.

    Release and Exit:
        Dispatch Updates Info: If there are any changes to the truck or load details, dispatch updates these in the system.
        Guard Verification: When the driver exits, the guard uses the form number to retrieve exit requirements in the system, confirming the trailer number, seal, and any other details.
        Electronic Signature on SigPad: The guard may request the driver’s electronic signature on a signature pad to confirm the exit process.
        Final Seal and Exit: If a seal is required, the guard applies the seal and verifies all exit protocols before allowing the driver to leave.

Summary of Key Points:

    Form Number Only: QR code generation can be defined later; for now, drivers use a printed form number.
    Electronic Signatures: Drivers provide electronic signatures on a signature pad when requested by dispatch or the guard.
    Physical Signatures for Shipping Documents: Shipping documents are handled separately by the warehouse and require the driver’s physical signature.
